A Portugese bank is rolling out term deposit for its customers. They have in the past connected to their customer base through phone calls. Results for these previous campaigns were recorded and have been provided to the current campaign manager to use the same in making this campaign more effective.
Challenges that the manager faces are following:
•  Customers have recently started to complain that bank’s marketing staff bothers them with irrelevant product calls and this should        immediately stop
•  There is no prior framework for manager to decide and choose which customer to call and which one to leave alone

Manager has decided to use past data to automate this decision, instead of manually choosing through each and every customer. Previous campaign data which has been made available to them; contains customer characteristics , campaign characteristics, previous campaign information as well as whether customer ended up subscribing to the product as a result of that campaign or not. Using this they plan to develop a statistical model which given this information predicts whether customer in question will subscribe to the product or not. A successful model which is able to do this, will make their campaign efficiently targeted and less bothering to uninterested customers.
